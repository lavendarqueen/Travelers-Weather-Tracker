# Travelers-Weather-Tracker

## Description

This application is a weather tracker to be used to track the weather where you are, as well as any travel destinations you might plan to visit. It was created with data obtained from the local weather API to create a simple and functional user interface.

- Motivation: To build an application that would be both useful and easy to use.
- I wanted to build an application to help travelers track the weather at their destinations.
- This application can help prospective travelers to make decisions regarding the best time to travel to a chosen destination.
- I learned how to request and receive data from a web API and render it into a simple and functional application.

## Installation

Upon opening the application at www.github.com/lavendarqueen/Travelers-Weather-Tracker/, the user inputs the name of the city for which he needs weather information and clicks on the Search button. Then the city name appears witha 5-day forecast. If weather for other cities is desired, the user can perform additional searches in the same manner.

## Usage

1. Go to www.github.io to Open the Traveler's Weather Tracker.

2. Input the name of the city for which you need weather information.

3. Click on the Search button.

4. For weather information for additional cities, repeat the instructions above.

Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
A GitHub profile with consistently high-quality README files is sure to help you stand out among the crowd of developers putting their work on GitHub, so make sure you give these important files the time and attention they deserve.
