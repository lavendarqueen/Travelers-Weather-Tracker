# Travelers-Weather-Tracker

## Description

This application is a weather tracker to be used to track the weather where you are, as well as any travel destinations you might plan to visit. It was created with data obtained from the local weather API to create a simple and functional user interface.

- Motivation: To build an application that would be both useful and easy to use.
- I wanted to build an application to help travelers track the weather at their destinations.
- This application can help prospective travelers to make decisions regarding the best time to travel to a chosen destination.
- While building this app, I learned how to request and receive data from a web API and render it into a simple and functional application.
